            <h3 class="h-k">Macro Mill Plus CNC is the successor to the Macro Terminal CNC. This application was created on the basis of many opinions and observations of the users of the Macro Terminal CNC and others. Unfortunately, the Macro Terminal CNC was not prepared for such a number of improvements and additions and it was necessary to create a new application from scratch.</h3>

            <h1>Safeness & productivity</h1>
            <h3 class="h-k">Macro Mill Plus CNC - the most powerful application for CNC machines ever created! Many errors and potentially dangerous cases are already checked when writing a CNC program, and the rest after its execution. It doesn't matter if you want to use CNC macros or some other form of programming (absolute, relative or polar), AVS (Advanced Validation System) will check your program as an experienced programmer is only able to do it!</h3>

            <h3 class="h-k">The Macro Mill Plus CNC is extremely fast thanks to the rebuilt interpreter and graphics module. This makes the Macro Mill Plus CNC a better solution for heavy and complex CNC programs. The graphics module is 100x faster than the one used in the Macro Terminal CNC. In addition, it offers a preview and simulation of the tool path in 3D and its rotation, shift, etc.</h3>

            <h3>This new feature in Macro Mill Plus CNC has greatly improved the perception and analysis of the toolpath, which is very important to avoid potential collisions or erroneous values especially in the "Z" axis. In addition, the ability to rotate the image 180 degrees to each side, its shift and zoom allows you to better look at all the details, even on a small screen!
