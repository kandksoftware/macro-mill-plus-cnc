            Macro Mill Plus CNC is the successor to the Macro Terminal CNC, the first application of this type for portable devices, which has gained great recognition by many professionals and is used, among others by: Alstom, US Navy or Lukoil. The Makro CNC Terminal has been constantly improved with new functionalities based, among others, on the opinions of our users. Unfortunately, the Macro Terminal CNC was not prepared for such a number of improvements and additions and it was necessary to create a new application from scratch. And so the Macro Mill Plus CNC was born. The most modern and advanced environment for creating CNC macro programs and any other CNC programs for CNC milling machines and CNC machining centers.
In this application, great emphasis was placed on speeding up the work of the interpreter. A 3D image has been added showing the toolpath and the tools used. Improved graphics module (almost 100 times faster than the one used in the Macro Terminal CNC!). However, the most important thing was the emphasis on security by adding to the application AVS (Advanced Validation System), a system that checks the program you create.
Due to the complexity, this application does not support CNC lathes as was the case with its predecessor. This task was taken over by Macro Lathe CNC, which specializes in creating and simulating CNC programs for this type of machine (CNC lathes).
