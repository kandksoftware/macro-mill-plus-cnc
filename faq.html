          <h1 class="faq__title">FAQ</h1>
          <div class="separator"></div>
          <h2 class="faq__question">Whether the purchase is indefinite or has a validity period.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">The purchase is for an unlimited period of time and has no expiry date.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">(For Android devices) I cannot find the file after saving it.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">The newly saved file can be found in the download folder.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">(For IOS devices) I cannot find the saved files folder after updating the application.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">Sometimes the new updated application references a different folder (IOS bug). 
            Try this: Press "Browse" then "On My Iphone". You should see the previously created folder here.
            If it does not work, please contact us.</a>
          </p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">The message "Program not found" appears.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">You are probably using the wrong settings - for example: if you want to create a program for a Haas machine, select the Haas option in the settings panel. If it does not work, please contact us.</p>
          
          <h2 class="faq__question">I found an error, what should I do?</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">If you found any bug, please contact us.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">I cannot save the file.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">On your device, go to settings, find “apps”, then find Macro Mill Plus CNC, select "allowed storage".
          If it has not worked, please contact us.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">After pressing the execution button (light gray triangle in the upper right corner of the top bar) "Execution in progress" state does not change.</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">This could be because your program is very long, has many loops, or has many nested loops. In this case, wait for a while for the program to complete. However, if the execution time is more than 30 seconds, it may mean a looping of the program. To finish its execution, press the red stop button. If you cannot find the wrong part in your code, go to "Exec line / Line by line” and press "Play" or " Play fast". After a while you should recognize what part of the code is repeating itself. If you are still unsure, press "Stop" and then manually step through the lines using the "Next" button.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">There were some warnings during the execution of the program, can I still use this program?</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">Yes, warnings do not mean that your program is buggy, but rather are intended to draw attention to possible unclear situations that may consequently be dangerous.</p>
          <h2 class="faq__question">The rendered image is so large that I cannot shift it to see all the details. What should I do?</h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">In the "Settings" panel, change the table settings to the size that matches the size of your CNC milling machine or CNC machining center.</p>
